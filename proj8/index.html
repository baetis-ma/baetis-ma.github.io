   <h1>OLED Display with ADC and Microphone</h1>
      <img src="./combined.jpg" style="width:35%;">
   <div id="intro">
      <p>This is an esp-idf project with an ESP32S, a pcf8591 adc, a max9814 microphone and 
         an SSD1306 128x64 oled display. The project is in two parts, the first shows the
         waveform of sound picked up by the micophone and the seocond shows the frequency.
      <p>The first of the waveforms shown above is of my daughter whisteling at about
         1.2KHz, the samples are taken ar about a 10K sample per second rate (the i2c
         clock is programmed at 100KHz) with 128 samples shown across the display. The
         spectrum below it is her making approximately the same whistle while running
         basically the same program but passing the result through an fft. Any FFT sample
         size over 64 samples crashed my ESP32. Notice the nice pure tone on the spectrum
         display - right around where you would expect 1KHz to be, the lower bar is the
         1.25v dc bias expected from our module. The other waveform 
         display output is of Montana whisteling at about 500Hz.
      <p>I tried testing some test tones from youtube videos through my computer's
         speakers and got absolutely aweful results. I have not diagnosed the source of
         these errors yet as my signal source requirement was by the occupant of the
         adjacent desk. The waveform display of the signals looks reasonable but the
         resulting spectrum display hardly showed a maxima.
