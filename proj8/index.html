   <h1>OLED Display with ADC and Microphone</h1>
      <img src="./combined.jpg" style="width:35%;">
   <div id="intro">
      <p>This is an esp-idf project with an ESP32S, a pcf8591 adc, a max9814 microphone and 
         an SSD1306 128x64 oled display. The project is in two parts, the first shows the
         waveform of sound picked up by the micophone and the seocond shows the frequency.
      <p>The max9814 moudule has a microphone and an agc. The output has a 1.25v bias and
         a 2.0 volt peak to peak signal. This analog output goes to the pcf8591 adc where
         128 byte burst reads are done in a while loop (the ssd1306 oled display has 128
         columns). The i2c clock is set at 100KHz which is a burst sample rate of about
         10Ksamples/sec and a full sample interval of 12.8msec, this is about the fastest
         the pcf8591 specification recomments running the part (although you can probably
         get 15-30% more - didn't try it). The oled display frame buffer is written and 
         the loop starts over again. The display updates several times per second with i
         little flicker.
      <p>The first of the waveforms shown above is of my daughter whisteling at about
         1.2KHz, the samples are taken ar about a 10K sample per second rate (the i2c
         clock is programmed at 100KHz) with 128 samples shown across the display. The
         spectrum below it is her making approximately the same whistle while running
         basically the same program but passing the result through an fft. Any FFT sample
         size over 64 samples crashed my ESP32. Notice the nice pure tone on the spectrum
         display - right around where you would expect 1KHz to be, the lower bar is the
         1.25v dc bias expected from our module. The other waveform 
         display output is of Montana whisteling at about 500Hz.
      <p>I tried testing some test tones from youtube videos through my computer's
         speakers and got absolutely aweful results. I have not diagnosed the source of
         these errors yet as my signal source requirement was by the occupant of the
         adjacent desk. The waveform display of the signals looks reasonable but the
         resulting spectrum display hardly showed a maxima. Update - looked at this a 
         little more and appearently my computer usb speakers are quite bad even
         though they sound pretty good to me, even my cell phone looked slightly better 
         with downloaded .wav tones.
      <p>Currently both programs are contained in the same project and the way to switch
         between them is to make sure that only one of the waveform.c/spectrum.c actually
         has the .c extension. One of the programs can be disabled by adding an additional
         non-compilable extension to the file name - as an example in this project
         the spectrum.c.no will not compile and waveform.c does giving the waveform
         oled display. This can be switched over to switch between the display types
         with a gpio mode pin (gpio=gnd for waveform and gpio=1 spectrum display). 
      <p>Update : updated waveform display to a scatter plot waveform instead of the
         bar chart shown in this documentations pictures. Also got rid of the 8bit pcf8591
         analog to digital converter and used a ads1115 adc.
