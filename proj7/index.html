   <h1>DHT Home Network</h1>
      <img src="./dht_home_sheet.png" style="width:35%;">
   <div id="intro">
      <p>This is an esp-idf project with an ESP32S, five esp8266 modules of various 
         types, six DHT-11 or 22 modules and an SSD1306 128x64 oled display. Temperature
         and Humity measumrents are taken about every two seconds and broadcast from
         a udp socket on each of the remore esp8266s. The esp32 base station collects
         the packet data from the five remote stations and updates the ssd1306 display
         as well as fowarding the data to google sheets for archeiving and display.
      <p>The remote sensors are all esp8266 based and of several different module type
         (lolin, wemos, miniD1 and esp-01) running basically the same program but with different
         build enviroments. Several of the remote sensor modules were built using the 
         esp-idf, but, I had trouble getting the DHT-11's to work with the esp-idf
         so I fell back to the nodemcu lua environment (which just works at what it does) 
         with several
         of the remote sensors. I like the nodemcu-tool command with the lua programming.
      <p>The function of the remote sensors is to aquire and report data. To that end
         each of the units is running a two second loop that reads the attached DHT
         device to obtain 16 bit temperature and humidity data which are encapsulated
         in a string along with the remote units identifing name, for example:
         "station3,205,540". The loop then sets up a wifi connection to router and a
         udp socket at port 5000 and IP address 192.168.0.255 and sends the string. 
         All the devices on my lan have the address 192.168.0.xxx (TP-Link router),
         it is important that the address contains the subnet address of yout lan.
         The last byte of 255 is a broadcast setting that should be received by everything
         on my home network. UDP sockets use less resources than TCP (no checking, acknologing, etc)
         and the reception every one of these packets is not critical, so less network
         resources are wasted. This saves having to program (or somehow otherwise inform)
         the base station IP to each of the remote units. So, there are five remote sensors out
         there in stategic positions each blasting station,temperature,humidity to my router
         every two seconds, next a description of the base station functionality.
      <p>The base station will collect and report our data. Data is collected from two locations,
         the base station's local DHT-22 and a udp socket listening for traffic with it's port
         and IP address (or .255). First we establish connection to wifi router and are assigned 
         an IP address. There are two main tasks looping in the base station : udp_server_task 
         and https_request_task.
      <p>udp_server_task sets up a udp socket listening for any network traffic at port 5000
         and at it's IP address (or local network byte = 255). When listen is satisfied it reads
         the receive buffer and closes the socket. The string is parsed, the data is crunched and 
         the global data array is updated. This loop also updates the ssd1306 oled display with
         the current data.
      <p>https_request_task runs in a loop that is programmed by the request_rate integer (seconds).
         The socket performs an https request at to url accessable web application ata web address

         The name of the web app assigned when this sheet was created is 
         <font color="red">
         <br>https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxVs4M6l3cd7ykBfJrtif03BhVFoPmCY1yYutIf/exec
         </font>
         <br>This is the address of a web app that was created when I created a google sheets spreadsheet
         and deployed it, a good description of this process is
         <a href="https://wp.josh.com/2014/06/04/using-google-spreadsheets-for-logging-sensor-data/">
         here</a>. This is the base web url that is used to add data to the spread sheet, to add data to
         the spreadsheet, data is appended to the base url - for example appending <font color="red">
         "?Time=12&T1=23&H1=67"</font>
         to the base url will add a new row under the Time, T1 and H1 data columns in the spreadsheet
         in your google account that you setup in very close to real time. When the
         udp_server_task collected new data and wote the oled display, described above, another thing that i
         it did was keep this
         web_url string updated for use whenever the https_request_task runs. https_request_task
         sets up a connection to the web address, when that connection is made it takes this 
         web_url string and embeds it in a request string which it transmits, google responds with html
         telling you that data update received.
      <p>Part of the making connection to web the address described above is not entirely straight forward
         with secure http requests. The handshaking requires that a pem security certificate be
         transmitted (noticed that it takes about 1.5 seconds for connection). This is handled by the
         esp-idf framework but requires that you download and embed a main/server_root_cert.pem file
         for each IP address. I think that the .pem file included in this project will work across the
         https://script.google.com address, if not directions can be found in the components/https_request.h
         file in the project to make a compatible file.
