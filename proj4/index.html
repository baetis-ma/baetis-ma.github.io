   <h1>Magnetometer Demonstration</h1>
      <img src="./hcm5883ss.png" style="width:40%">
   <div id="intro">
      <p>This is an esp-idf project with a ESP32S and an HMC5883L I2C magnetometer
         module. Recently ordered new magnetometer and found a part change, the
         qms588l i2c address and registers are completely different, programs 
         are included for either device.
      <p>These are amazing little mems devices able to measure minute magnetic
         fields as indeed is the earth magnetic field at the surface. Care must
         be taken in operating these device away from items that are ferroelectric,
         conducting current or able to alter earth's field locally or results can
         be affected substaincally - like 2 inches from an iron screw. This product
         helps you evaluate to what extent you can take advantage of the magnetometer in
         your application's code. As you move through all the axes combinations to
         get some ifeel for the device and some good calibration numbers, for the 
         current placement of the
         magnetometer, an area showing the calibration code is shown for cut
         and paste.
      <p>The webpage updates at programmable interval up to about 5 times per
         second before tcp transactions start backing up. The page holds several 
         data presentation divs described below
         <ul><li> a list of calculated parameters so you can monitor the
                  calibration progress and check the cartesian to spherical
                  conversion. 
                  <ul><li> magnitude = Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)
                      <li> theta = 57.3 * Math.acos ( z / magnitude)
                      <li> phi = 57.3 * Math.atan ( y / x )
                      <li> if (x < 0) phi = phi + 180
                  </ul>
                  The magnitude comes out very close to 1 after calibration
                  and represents the total magnetic fieldi (about 50,000 nT). 
                  theta is how much
                  that vector is rotates from straight up and phi is how 
                  much the vertor is rotated on the x-y plane.
             <li> an image of the actual orientation of the magnetometer. As
                  the screen updates several time per second the image of
                  the module is presented with a css transform with the
                  calculated theta and phi values with the following javaScript
                  command
                  <ul><font size="1" color="darkgray">document.getElementById
                     ("myMod").style.transform = "rotateX("+theta+"deg)
                     rotateZ("+phi+"deg)";</font></ul>
                  When the theta measurement is between 90-270 degrees a
                  bottom side image of the module is displayed instead to the
                  top - at this point I have not grasped the math of coverting
                  the z axis tilt separated into x and y rotations so the
                  x and y rotations are currently zeroed out.
             <li> a plotly graph of the 'normalizing' x, y and z axis flux is 
                  displayed on top graph. The device is contineously being
                  calibrated and as the min and max for each axes are updated
                  and the old data along with the new are reploted. 
             <li> and a graph of the extracted spherical coordinates theta 
                  (tilt) and phi (xy axis rotation) is diectly underneath.
             <li> a plotly 3D plot of the flux vector is on the lower left
                  of the screen. The 3d plot loses the page a little 
                  reponsiveness so a button to shut off the 3d graph is included.
             <li> Button included to restart calibration.
         </ul>
      <p>When the device was being read at about 50 xyz measurements
         per second the magnetometer was getting seriously hot. At 10
         sample sets per second the device is noticably cooler but still
         pretty warm. Pieces of metal and (especially) magnets within a
         foot or so affect measurements. The device could be used to 
         track the position and orientation of a strong magnet up to a
         few feet away I would imagine.
      <p>The device is surprisingly 
         accurate after rotating the device through several axis (at
         least five and pretty evenly spaced). I have not tried
         storing calibration values to see how they would track
         over time but go through the calibration dance after each powerup.
         After pointing the modules x-axis at north I noticed I was off by 
         about 15 degrees and I wasn't getting 180 on my theta. I checked 
         out a NOAA Magnetic Field Calculator and discovered my location
         has a -14 degree 6 minute declination ans a 67 degree 0 minute
         inclination, that explains that.
       <p>More observations -
         The first time I tested this device it was attached to
         the ESP32 with some pretty long jumper wires. Installing 
         the module on a solderless prototype board changed the 
         calibration values and even mixed up the magnetic field axis,
         probably making calibrating out the affect impossible.
         So note in presence of any close-by ferrous metals or 
         magnetic materials (or current?) the earth's magnetic field 
         is complicated and axis misshape. However, the free standing 
         module seems to hold calibration over a few days so far.
