   <h1>LiPo Battery Tool</h1>
      <img id="img0" src="./lipohtml.png" style="width:45%;">
   <div id="intro">
       <p>This is an esp-idf project with the purpose of outputting a LiPo battery
         tester and charger. My daughter and I have recently begun flying some
         drones and find ourselves in posession various 1S, 2S and 3S cells. They were
         all very inexpensive and/or used and seem to vary a bit in power storage -
         we would like to check out our batteries to find which are best and build
         a charger with more capabilities than the ones we have.
      <p>Plans are to have a standalone ESP and hardware assembly with a 1inch OLED
         display, a 3 ohm power load, 0-2A programmable current source and a 4
         channel ADC. Assembly control, monitoring and data analysis via webpage.
      <p>Design Goals
         <ul><li> Monitor Cell Voltages of LiPo Battery stack.
             <li> In Charge Mode : charge each battery to 4.2 Volts at preset current (0-2A)
                  while monitoring charge.
             <li> In Discharge Mode : monitor discharge of battery into a fixed 3 ohm load
                  while integrating charge to determine battery capacity.
             <li> In Discharge to 3.8 Volt Mode : get battery to 3.8 Volts by discharging
                  or charging prior to period of inactivity.
             <li> Using PCF8591
         </ul>
