   <h1>F450 Drone Build with ESP</h1>
      <img id="img0" src="./f450kit.jpg" style="width:35%;">
   <div id="intro">
      <p>This is an esp-idf project with an ESP32 acting as a flight controller and receiver
         for F450 quadcoptor drone and an esp8266 D1 mini as radio control transmitter.
      <p>I did a project recently with an mcp6050 gyroscope and accelerometer, impressed with
         the capabilities and ability to keep a reasonable integral of inexpensive mems
         sensors I decided to find something to control. Some ebay searches pretty quickly
         lead me to consider building a quad copter. I soon found a kit containing f450 
         frame, brush-less motors, electronic speed controllers
         and props for a little over $50. They even threw in a CC3D flight controller module,
         which not part of the original plan helped firm up a development strategy. My plan
         is to develop stable platform that will hover (and return) to one spot before trying
         to focus on 'flight' concerns.
      <p>I've been hobbying around with esp devices for a few months now and have decided to
         use an esp8266 D1 mini as my transmitter base station and an esp32 as my receiver and
         flight controller. At first the flight controller aspects will be shared with the
         CC3D flight controller that I got with my kit package. I hope to integrate the CC3D
         functionality into the esp32 as we go along, but there is a lot of learning to do 
         here that I can reverse engineer with the CC3D and cleanflight.
      <p>Transmitter requirements : 
         <ul><li> Two way comms to at least 200 feet
             <li> be able to sustain packet rate of at least 10/sec (hopefully 50/sec)
             <li> collect data from a couple joysticks, switches and a display
             <li> return blackbox data from flight controller at packet rate to serial port
         </ul>
      <p>Using a webpage as input and a TCP connection between transmitter did not work out,
         I have familiarity with the IP and was able to test it out in a few hours. Packets
         started getting backed up at a 300msec launch rate, maybe this could be improved but
         probably not by a order of magnitude. A couple of browser joysticks on a cell phone
         might have been nice, right now this approach seems to have limited capability but might
         be worth revisting in the future if a low update rate control seems able to control
         the copter. The project is now heading in a transmitter to flight
         controller receiver interface using espnow framed wifi station/access point connectivity
         and i2c interface to ground station hardware (physical joysticks, switches and display).
         Tests showed a 3x range improvement over my router without the connection and 
         tethering hassles, and much much better packet rates. The espnow protocol is
         directly between the esp devices to their mac addresses with crc checks and limited
         handshaking.
         <br>The joysticks being, temporarily, used are pretty horrible. They have a huge
         dead spot at the center where the output resistance doesn't change for about 15
         degrees each side of center and the rest of the range is used up well before coming 
         to limit of travel, so the whole usable range is about 15-40 degrees each side
         of center. The joysticks center position resistance varies considerably and needs
         to be calibrated and they return to center.
         <br>A data acquire task loop is run in the transmitter to read voltage values from
         an ads1015 every 20msec. The readings are used to update local values for throttle,
         yaw, pitch and roll. The yaw, pitch and roll are 10bit values coming from the adc,
         the center rest position value is subtracted, the result adjusted by a chosen gain
         and added or subtracted (depending on orientation of joystick) to 1500. The throttle
         returns to center so its reading (after calibration offset) is accumulated 
         (and multiplied by chosen gain) and added to 1000.
         <br>Events are scheduled to run espnow_send every 20msec and a callback for
         espnow packets received. The espnow_send transmits a string containing the throttle,
         yaw, pitch, yaw and other parameters. The callback string received from the 
         flight controller contains telemetry (blackbox) data which is forwarded to the 
         console serial port for collection by attached pc for analysis.
      <p>Flight Controller and receiver requirements :
         <ul><li> Acquire gyro/accel data and transmitter inputs to control motor speeds
             <li> Return telemetry data to transmitter ground station
         </ul>         
      <p>The current goal of the project is use the CC3D flight controller with an
         esp32 receiver interface. The CC3D has a nice interface to simulators such as
         cleanflight that allow easy setup of ESPs, mems and motor calibration, pids and
         filtering and telemetry data collection as long as connected (these features will
         help get started a lot quicker and provide a great debug assistance). The esp32
         receiver will need to talk to the CC3D flight controller to supply transmitter data
         and to obtain telemetry data and write pid, filter and status registers.
         <br>When the CC3D flight controller is attached to cleanflight and you snoop on the 
         port with an intermediary (interceppty worked for me - or using three usb dongles)
         you can see binary data being transferred which turns out to be MultiWii Serial
         Protocol (MSP), full documentation is hard to find but can be pieced together and checked
         against snoop data to come up with a good mcp.h file. The actual motor control
         path parameters (throttle, yaw, pitch, roll, motor speeds) all seem to be blocked
         read only with the MSP interface at least with my CC3D board (this board also didn't work
         with later versions of software so I used cleanflight to download firmware backwards until
         the CC3D booted up). I have gotten one of the CC3D serial ports hooked up to
         my esp8266 (which I am doing initial development with) to read mcp parameters from the 
         CC3D, and even to negotiate an esp32 hookup directly to cleanflight.
         <br>The motor control path variable can not be written with MSP with my version of
         CC3D and I do not want to use servo pulses to import my throttle, yaw, etc..
         values to the flight controller. Decided to use the SBUS semi-digital protocol
         for this purpose, my version of CC3D also does not support the sbus_invert cli
         command so an inverter had to be built from a 2N2222 and two resistors. To help
         debug the development of the SBUS interface I wrote a couple C programs 
         <a href="https://github.com/baetis-ma/linux2sbus">(repository here)</a>on my desktop to
         write SBUS protocol packets for 16+2 channels and another to monitor and decode
         SBUS packets. Both the esp8266 and the linux program have demonstrated SBUS packet 
         transmission to the CC3D flight controller as monitored by the cleanflight transmitter i
         tab and flight simulator. 
      <p>So, at this point, I can have my CC3D flight controller on my desk hooked up to my
         desktop and walk 150 feet down the street with my ground station sending throttle,
         yaw, pitch and roll information. Still need to verify that the other CC3D port can
         be used so that the esp32 can have SBUS and MSP running at the same time with
         the flight controller - just sending a dummy packet back right now.
      <p>My F450 drone kit has literally just arrived from it's slow trip across the pacific,
         actually it took exactly two weeks - about half of the estimated delay (I still don't
         have any batteries so I just ordered some 3s's from amazon - things cost 60% of what
         the whole drone cost - find it amazing that a small battery like that can put out 
         80Amps!). Got a lot of work to do building this thing and not make it look like a
         kludge, but just got a new soldering iron and plan to look at some youtube F450
         builds before smashing the thing in uncontrolled ascent to ceiling (considering 
         various mechanical tethering options). Having the cleanflight interface for initial
         setup will save a lot of time.
      <p>----------- Log Entry (09-30-19) -------------
      <p>Deceided to upgrade the drone side ESP device to a ESP32 module instead of the ESP8266
         D1mini that was being used using initial espnow checkout, figure that the ESP32 leaves 
         more room for future enhancements. Noticed I was getting a little bit of noise in the 
         cleanflight transmitter tab - every few seconds my throttle, yaw, pitch and roll values 
         would jump around a bit even though the controls on the ground station were not touched. 
         For the sbus signal  inverter I was using the 3.3v from the esp32 module. To add a 5 volt 
         level to my system had to go external because there appears to be no way to get the esp32 
         module or the cc3d flight controller board to source +5volts (plan to use dc-dc converter
         to generate +5v from the 3s lipo).  I, temporarily, added the +5v from a usb to serial 
         dongle and now the sbus interface has had no errors in the half hour I observed. 
         I include a 
         <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16zrWSgeVZqAOGRBdouZs-SjIfwVNKjcI">
         link to video </a> of the setup as it current is controlling a drone simulator on the 
         cleanflight transmitter tab page.
      <p>One nasty that did occur as I was writing the sbus code for the esp32 module. I had 
         the code ported from the esp8266 to the esp32 and it looked to be just about 
         running, I was testing it with my desktop linux sbus_monitor program and noticed 
         that about 5% of packets were showing up bad. The esp8255 D1mini did not show 
         any packet loss. When I plugged the sbus into the cc3d there were no received 
         packets (and no way to find out why apparently). Went back to the sbus_monitor 
         program to debug packet loss and discovered the following in the table shown 
         below.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>SBUS Serial Port Buad Rate ESP32 Port</th>
	  <th>Packet Loss Percentage to sbus_monitor program</th>	
          <th>Packet Loss to CC3D SBUS port</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>95,000 </th><th>100%</th><th>100%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>98,000 </th><th>~10%</th><th>100%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>100,000</th><th> ~5%</th><th>100%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>101,000</th><th> ~1%</th><th>~~20%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>102,000</th><th> ~0%</th><th> ~0%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>103,000</th><th> ~1%</th><th>~~20%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>104,000</th><th> ~5%</th><th>100%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>105,000</th><th>~10%</th><th>100%</th></tr>
        <tr><th>100,000</th><th>100%</th><th>100%</th></tr>
      </table>
      <p>The esp32 module programmed with a sbus baud rate of 102,000 does not show any 
         packet loss as far as I can see. Interestingly the cc3d sbus connection does 
         show sbus packet confusion at 101,000 and 103,000, the port does not register 
         any activity at 100,000 or 104,000 baud. Which is to say that the cc3d is much 
         more sensitive to baud rate than my desktop. This problem would have been VERY 
         complicated to debug without the linux sbus_monitor program. cleanflight doesn't 
         seem to have much in the line of port packet monitoring or diagnostics (except 
         for the usb port).
      <p>As was mentioned earlier the esp8266 modules appeared to have no problem with 
         the 100,000 non-standard baud rate generation and I don't know if other esp32 
         modules are off by the same amount.
      <p>Got my batteries today and plan to start build of quadcopter with my daughter within
         the next few days.
      <p>----------- Log Entry (10-02-19) -------------
      <p>Managed to get rid of the SBUS inverter by switching to the second uart port (uart3
         in clenflight) on the CC3D (labelled flexiport instead of main port). Also have uart1
         configured as configuration/msp port at 115,200buad which I hope to use to send
         telemerty/blackbox data down to ground station transmitter. In cleanflight it looks like
         only one serial port can be configured serial rx at a time, when a configured both
         uart1 and uart3 to serial rx only uart1 was active. When uart1 was configured
         configuration/msp uart3 started working as serial rx which I configured to sbus.
      <p>Further communications testing looking very promising two way espnow betwen rx and tx
         and sbus to flight controller.
      <p>Add ssd1305 display to ground station transmitter for real time display of throttle,
         yaw, pitch and roll. I really dislike the cheap joysticks and am looking for 
         replacement - I added the display to help me get used to the play on these controls,
         they have to be moved a lot off center before value changes at all and then it maxes
         out with very little further travel.
      <p>----------- Log Entry (10-03-19) -------------
      <p>Its time to outline data acquisition, filtering and control goals and implementation
         stages. As a first guess this is what is being experimented with first.
      <p>Acquisition : Gyroscope data will be stored in fifo at 1KHz rate, accelerometer data 
         gathered at 20msec interval at which time data is processed through filtering, control
         loop and downloaded. Other data such as magnetometer, barometer, laser range finder, 
         gps, etc. may also be collected if new hardware is added.
      <p>Filtering : The MPU6050 accelerometer data I am familiar with has a large high frequency
         component that we do not want getting into our feedback control loop, we should be
         designing toward a two pole low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency somewhere in the 
         range of .5-2Hz. The gyroscope data will be used for the higher frequency flight 
         adjustments, the lower frequency drift component may need to be filtered out. It may
         turn out to be useful to notch filter the servo motor control outputs for any observed
         system sympathetic resonance.
      <p>Feedback Control :  Three 1KHz PID loops are necessary to control the yaw, pitch and
         roll axis which will use the gyroscope data. The inputs for each of these loops will
         be the result that we desire on each on each the integrated gyroscope axis - which can
         be imagined as something like the angle that we would like. The output
         of these loops will be combined up to generate servo commands to each of the four motors.
         Suppose for example we would like to move forward - the transmitter sends a servo pitch
         value that specifies a desired forward tilt to the craft. The control loop will speed 
         up the back rotors, lifting the back of the drone (and creating force in x axis) until 
         the gyroscope catches up to the forward tilt command, the speed and stability of this 
         transaction is determined by the P, I and D loop multipliers. Gyroscope data is useful 
         to keep the craft in a desired attitude (not rotating on x (yaw), y (roll) or z (pitch) 
         axes), these are the inner high speed, 1KHz, portion of the control circuit.
         <br>The accelerometer data provides information to the control loop that helps to
         imply an xyz point that we wish to maintain. Each of these axes will also have a PID loops
         moderating corrections, these are the outer 50Hz portion of the control circuit. For example, 
         if the wind is blowing the gyroscope would not notice it (unless the drone was being twisted)
         but the accelerometer would notice an x or y acceleration. This can be somewhat controlled out
         with accelerometer data PID loops whose output is feed into the gyroscope PID loops
         just like transmitter pitch or roll inputs (ie I'm getting pushed to the right by a
         force so lean into it - P gain is how much to lean, I gain is how much to recover from
         a previous uncorrected push and D gain tells to loop closure to slow down once you start getting 
         close). In software, PID loops are very simple - an error signal is generated at the input
         which is the difference between the angle that you want the quadcopter to be in and the
         angle that the gyroscope measures that it is in. The error then follows three paths.
         The P(roportional) path is simply multiplied by the P gain. The I path has an accumulator
         which is the sum of all previous error inputs which is multiplied by I(ntegral) gain.
         The D(erivative) path is the difference between the current error signal and the 
         previous one which is then multiplies by the D gain. The output of the loop is the sum
         of these three, PID, paths which are combined with the other gyroscope PID loops outputs
         to generate motor speed commands. Tuning the loop gain parameters can either be done by
         simulation or tuning the actual system flight response.
      <p>BlackBox Telemetry : A data packet will be sent to the ground station for collection
         every 20ms (50 times per second). The payload frame will contain the filtered acceleration
         3 axis data, slots for future use (magnetometer, status, estimated altitude, etc) within 
         the first 50 bytes. Initially, 150 bytes will be reserved for the raw gyroscope datar,
         eventually we will use bits in a configuration word to determine the configuration of the
         payload (if for example we would like to collect raw motor servo data).
      <p>Milestones : First target is to collect all necessary data and blackbox it down to the
         ground station every 20mssec. The accelerometer data will be filtered. The gyroscope data
         will be sent down as raw byes from the mpu6050 fifo read. First test flights will probably
         be with the CC3D flight controller doing the actual work and the data being collected by
         the esp32 flight controller only reporting gyroscope and accelerometer data. Next step will
         be to start programming CC3D flight controller with PID gains of 1,0,0, which basically
         shuts off PID and sends input data to motors. Then lastly control motors directly from
         esp32 flight controller.
      <p>----------- Log Entry (10-04-19) -------------
      <p>Got done building and testing a 50msec loop in the esp32 flight controller that reads three
         axes of acceleration data, from a mpu6050, and filters it through a 4 pole butterworth.
         Also wrote an acceleration calibration subroutine (average of 16 measurements), also bought
         a small (32mm diameter) xy spirit level from ebay (75 cents) to mount on the quadcopter. 
         Tried several differnet cut-off frequencies, 0.25, 1, 4 and 10 Hz. The output displays roll 
         and pitch in degrees and the z-axis gravity. Just sitting on my desk running the 1Hz filter
         pitch and roll outputs were always within +/-0.2degrees and z-axis from 0.9997-1.003g. Tilting
         board 45 degrees gave me 45 degress roll or pitch and .707g z-axis. The 1Hz filter was steadier 
         than the 4 or 10Hz filters and the 0.25Hz just felt a little too slow. Found it really impressive
         how just pushing the board across the desk gives a real actionable signal - bet you could even
         build a pretty reasonable mouse. It also gives a strong integral signal that will be used to
         stand up against wind or returning to a location that it was pushed out of.
      <p>Started work on 20msec loop that will read 1KHz gyroscope outputs and process that data trough
         the integrators and PID that will eventually supply the motor outputs, the ESCs that came
         with my kit only take servo inputs so I will eventially have to deal with that. Collecting the
         data and doing limited processing is not unveiling any cpu resource problems at this point. I
         am getting more confident that this can work. 
      <p>Hardware wise, my daughter and I have kit mostly all built up to the point where we need to 
         start doing some soldering. Added a DC-DC converter to supply esp32 and CC3D.
      <p>----------- Log Entry (10-11-19) -------------
      <p>Last week we spent time doing all the placement, wiring soldering and heat shrink to our kit
         <img id="img1" src="./montanawiring.jpg" style="width:35%;">
         and it is looking pretty good. Montana has been taking the mechanical/hardware lead and logging
         most of the flight time while I have been sticking to the systems and sodtware end of things.
         The CC3D hooked up to cleanflight easily and we got the escs calibrated on the motors tab page,
         the motors all started at 1032 and sounded good.
         Next the props were reinstalled, the drone teethered and we spun up the motors a bit. Liftoff
         was shortly followed by instability and crash into pillows setup all around. Neither of us has
         never researched the actual mechanics of drone flight or ever flown a drone and it took a while
         to figure out the throttle=1000,yaw=2000 arming proceedure. The transmitter was not sending full 
         range so a few lines had to be added to code to arm and disarm. Our first test was a very short
         one endinging in what looked like a powered crash instead of just instability, quickly realized 
         flight controller needed to be facing forward so that correct motors would be getting corrections. 
         We did have a few newbie hickcups along the way - at first we, incorrectly, assumed the 1045R 
         props would go on the counterclockwise motors. Next we neglected to align the CC3D flight
         controller in the forward direction of the quadcopter as defined by out motor hookup.
      <p>Test flights are continuing and we are getting the hang of hovering and moving around a bit. The
         horrid joysticks are difficult to get used to and we are looking forward to replaceing them. 
      <p>Got a loop working with the ESP32 doing an SPI read of an MPU9250 reading gyroscope data being 
         loaded into fifo at 1K samples per second. I'm currently stuck getting the fifo dumps to run faster
         than 10ms (with an occasional 20ms) and the mpu9250 fifo length is 512 bytes - so I really can't
         quite get 8K samples per second to work - this will be revisited once 1K samples/sec working and
         deemed insufficient. There are several ways to do this that should be possible but going to try
         1K samples/sec first and make sure everything else works too. Setup integrators and PID controls
         and starting serious consideration of how to weight these in with control channels...
      <p>Considering taking a brief simulation detour but can't find much performance data to make calculations
         with. Without a good simulation, or proably even with one, need arises to develop good testing
         flows with realtime feedback to tune control system from total scratch. The default PID, filter and
         control flow of default CC3D controller with cleanflight are kind of surprisingly good. First test
         liftoffs of drone with direct motor control from master (a lied and attached props - but took
         teethering procaustions) were predictable very unstable. We attached CC3D flight controller with
         default settings, and after an initial try out where the flight controller was attached to frame
         not pointing forward - resulting in instant crash, jumped up to a hover and shows signs of real
         controlled flight. The joysticks that I have are still a major fustration (new ones on boat from 
         china) but the drone does fly and my daughter is getting pretty good at handling it.
      <p>----------- Log Entry (10-12-19) -------------
      <p>The CC3D that we have only seems to support gyroscope innerloop PIDs and accelerometer data is not 
         used. My hope in this project is not to build a racing drone but to build a drone that is stable
         and responds to commands with precision. The software for the gyroscope output inner control circuit
         is well underway, the focus now will shift to experimenting with accelerometer output to see how well
         it will calculate relative x, y and z distances (in feet) from where it was startup to see if this data
         can be accurate enough to run an outer loop.
